## Wiring Instructions

### 1. ESP32 to BTS7960 Motor Drivers

**Note:** You need to make connections for two BTS7960 motor driversâ€”one for the left motors and one for the right motors.

#### **ESP32 to Left BTS7960 Driver**

- **PWM Pin (RPWM)**
  - `GPIO 18` (leftMotorPwmPin) to **RPWM** on BTS7960.

- **Direction Pin (LPWM)**
  - `GPIO 19` (leftMotorDirectionPin) to **LPWM** on BTS7960.

- **Enable Pins (R_EN and L_EN)**
  - **Option 1:** Connect both **R_EN** and **L_EN** to `GPIO 23` (leftMotorEnablePin). Set pin HIGH in code to enable.
  - **Option 2:** Tie both **R_EN** and **L_EN** directly to 5V (always enabled).

- **VCC and GND**
  - Connect **VCC** to 5V (logic supply).
  - Connect **GND** to common ground.

#### **ESP32 to Right BTS7960 Driver**

- **PWM Pin (RPWM)**
  - `GPIO 21` (rightMotorPwmPin) to **RPWM** on BTS7960.

- **Direction Pin (LPWM)**
  - `GPIO 22` (rightMotorDirectionPin) to **LPWM** on BTS7960.

- **Enable Pins (R_EN and L_EN)**
  - **Option 1:** Connect both **R_EN** and **L_EN** to `GPIO 25` (rightMotorEnablePin). Set pin HIGH in code to enable.
  - **Option 2:** Tie both **R_EN** and **L_EN** directly to 5V (always enabled).

- **VCC and GND**
  - Connect **VCC** to 5V (logic supply).
  - Connect **GND** to common ground.

#### **Logic Level Considerations**

- **ESP32 Logic Level:** 3.3V
- **BTS7960 Logic Level:** 5V
- **Solution:** Use logic level converters to safely interface the ESP32 with the BTS7960 driver if necessary.

### 2. Motor Connections

- **Left Motors**
  - Connect the two left motors in parallel to the **M+** and **M-** terminals of the left BTS7960 driver.

- **Right Motors**
  - Connect the two right motors in parallel to the **M+** and **M-** terminals of the right BTS7960 driver.

### 3. Power Supply

- **Motor Power Supply**
  - Connect the positive terminal to **B+** and negative terminal to **B-** on both BTS7960 drivers.
  - Ensure the supply voltage matches the motors' voltage rating.

- **ESP32 Power Supply**
  - Power the ESP32 via USB or a separate regulated 5V supply.
  - **Important:** Do not power the ESP32 directly from the motor power supply.

- **Common Ground**
  - Connect all grounds (ESP32, BTS7960 drivers, and power supplies) together to maintain a common reference point.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Overview

The provided code initializes the ESP32, sets up motor control via PWM, and interfaces with the PS4 controller to control the robot's movement based on analog stick inputs.

### 2. Code Breakdown

```cpp
// Include necessary libraries
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <PS4Controller.h>
```

- Includes the core Arduino library and the PS4 controller library.

```cpp
// Define motor control pins
const int leftMotorPwmPin = 18;
const int leftMotorDirectionPin = 19;
const int rightMotorPwmPin = 21;
const int rightMotorDirectionPin = 22;
```

- Assigns GPIO pins for motor PWM and direction control.

```cpp
// Enable pins (if used)
const int leftMotorEnablePin = 23;
const int rightMotorEnablePin = 25;
```

- Assigns GPIO pins for enabling the motor drivers.

```cpp
// PWM settings
const int freq = 5000;
const int pwmResolution = 8;
const int pwmChannelLeft = 0;
const int pwmChannelRight = 1;
```

- Configures PWM frequency, resolution, and channels.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  // Initialize motor control pins
  pinMode(leftMotorDirectionPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rightMotorDirectionPin, OUTPUT);
  // Initialize motor enable pins
  pinMode(leftMotorEnablePin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rightMotorEnablePin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(leftMotorEnablePin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(rightMotorEnablePin, HIGH);
  // Configure PWM functionalities
  ledcSetup(pwmChannelLeft, freq, pwmResolution);
  ledcSetup(pwmChannelRight, freq, pwmResolution);
  // Attach the PWM channels
  ledcAttachPin(leftMotorPwmPin, pwmChannelLeft);
  ledcAttachPin(rightMotorPwmPin, pwmChannelRight);
  // Initialize PS4 controller
  if (PS4.begin()) {
    Serial.println("PS4 controller is ready to connect.");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize PS4 controller.");
  }
}
```

- Sets up serial communication, initializes pins, configures PWM, and starts the PS4 controller connection.

```cpp
void loop() {
  if (PS4.isConnected()) {
    // Read analog stick values
    int leftStickY = PS4.LStickY();
    int rightStickY = PS4.RStickY();
    // Map stick values to motor speeds
    int leftMotorSpeed = map(leftStickY, -128, 127, -255, 255);
    int rightMotorSpeed = map(rightStickY, -128, 127, -255, 255);
    // Control motors
    controlMotor(pwmChannelLeft, leftMotorDirectionPin, leftMotorSpeed);
    controlMotor(pwmChannelRight, rightMotorDirectionPin, rightMotorSpeed);
  }
}
```

- In the main loop, checks for PS4 controller connection, reads analog stick inputs, maps them to motor speeds, and controls the motors accordingly.

```cpp
void controlMotor(int pwmChannel, int directionPin, int speed) {
  if (speed >= 0) {
    digitalWrite(directionPin, HIGH);
    ledcWrite(pwmChannel, speed);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(directionPin, LOW);
    ledcWrite(pwmChannel, -speed);
  }
}
```

- Defines a function to control motor speed and direction based on the input speed value.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Pairing the PS4 Controller

1. **Put the PS4 Controller in Pairing Mode**
   - Press and hold the **Share** and **PS** buttons simultaneously.
   - The light bar will start flashing, indicating it's in pairing mode.

2. **Power On the ESP32**
   - Ensure the ESP32 is powered and running the uploaded code.
   - The ESP32 will automatically connect to the PS4 controller.

3. **Confirm Connection**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (baud rate 115200).
   - Look for the message **"PS4 controller is ready to connect."**
   - Once connected, the message **"PS4 controller connected successfully."** should appear.

### 2. Operating the Robot

- **Left Analog Stick**
  - Controls the speed and direction of the left motors.
  - Pushing forward moves the left motors forward; pulling back reverses them.

- **Right Analog Stick**
  - Controls the speed and direction of the right motors.
  - Similar to the left stick but for the right motors.

- **Maneuvering**
  - **Forward Movement:** Push both sticks forward.
  - **Reverse Movement:** Pull both sticks backward.
  - **Turning Left:** Push the right stick forward and the left stick neutral or backward.
  - **Turning Right:** Push the left stick forward and the right stick neutral or backward.

- **Motor Direction Incorrect**
  - Swap the motor connections on the BTS7960 driver or adjust the logic in the `controlMotor` function.

- **ESP32 Resets or Freezes**
  - **Power Issues:**
    - Use a separate, stable power supply for the ESP32.
  - **Noise Interference:**
    - Add decoupling capacitors and ensure proper grounding.
